## Hi there, I'm Dan 👋
Juggling 2 kids and code with the help of Mr. Tea and Coffee

I've been labeled a Ruby guy by folks who know me professionally.. I like writing elegant code and building cool things.

Vim is my editor of choice ( `gvim > vim > nvim`) and I write a few vim plugins here and there.
